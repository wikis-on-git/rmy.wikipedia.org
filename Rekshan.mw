Hi! My name is Jeno Balint, and I am looking for h.o.m.osx.ual Romani males for marriage. I love the Roma so much. I would even adopt Romani children. Here is my profile: <nowiki>https://rmy.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeno:Balint36&action=view</nowiki> If you're interested, please message me. I am by the way just a Gajo, so I would like to play the role of a sub in our future homosxual relationship. I am very open-minded. Even youngsters and old people can message me, but they must be Romani males. I hate females, I am disgusted of them.
