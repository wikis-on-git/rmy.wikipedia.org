<Guestav> hi....if you were a queen, would you sentence me to forced work in a saharan concentration camp?

<busTmom> now
<Guestav> and it would last for a lifetime?
<busTmom> ya
<busTmom> but you probably wouldn't last long
<Guestav> why?
<Guestav> would life be so hard there?
<busTmom> from all the forced labor, torture, disease, parasites and malnutrition

<busTmom> my enemies need to suffer
<busTmom> the entire universe and every living thing in it is done a grievous injustice by every nanosecond my enemies are allowed to exist without suffering
<Guestav> and the camp would be really so disgusting and dirty, full of shit, bugs, parasites?
<busTmom> ya
<Guestav> and where would we sleep?
<busTmom> a half rotted barn
<Guestav> oh my goodness
<Guestav> but could we have a bath or shower sometimes?
<busTmom> maybe
<Guestav> ohhh, it sounds such a horrible camp
<Guestav> would I scream of hopelessness if I saw it?
<busTmom> maybe
<Guestav> and would you camera the camp, and watch our suffering from home?
<busTmom> live steam it
<Guestav> would you enjoy it?
<busTmom> ya
<Guestav> the aim of the camp would be to bully, torture us and to make us suffer?
<busTmom> ya
<Guestav> what kind of forced labor would we exactly have to do, and what kind of torture would there be?
<busTmom> idk
<Guestav> but it would be horrible for sure?
<busTmom> ya
<Guestav> omg....so if it depended on you, I would get arrested right now and deported to a saharan concentration camp...and my horrible suffering would begin already today
<busTmom> all conservative christians deserve to die screaming blood gushing deaths
<Guestav> omg, you are such a strict princess 
<Guestav> and the camp would be disgusting and dirty only to make us suffer even more?
<busTmom> ya
<Guestav> btw, you can also send us to bloody wars for example...do you like that idea too?
<busTmom> idk
<Guestav> btw would there be an iron curtain like electric fence around the camp?
<busTmom> why not
<Guestav> omg, I cummed
